# Invoking the Bootloader

- Hardware.
	1. Turn OFF and ON the board with T2 pressed, blue LED glows indicating that the board switched to bootloader mode.
- Software
	1. Write 0x4E494F43 ('N','I','O','C') to MAGIC\_LOCATION (0x2003FFF4)
	2. Write 0x0 or 0xF0000 to APP\_START\_ADDR (0x2003FFF8)
	3. Call NVIC\_SystemReset()
	4. Invoke Bootloader from Software
```C
#define  MAGIC_LOCATION (0x2003FFF4)
#define  APP_START_ADDR (*(uint32_t *)(MAGIC_LOCATION+4)
 
*((uint32_t *)MAGIC_LOCATION) == 0x4E494F43;
APP_START_ADDR = 0xF0000;
//APP_START_ADDR = 0x0;
NVIC_SystemReset();
```
	5. The same feature can also be used to perform application switch ( 2 or more applications can reside in the same flash memory at different address locations ).
	Just write the application start address to APP\_START\_ADDR instead of bootloader address
